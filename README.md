# Project Description

A few simple python scripts to create aesthetically pleasing and conference/journal 'ready' plots

## Work in Progress

I am still in the process of deciding what to show and what data to use. 

The SimplePlots.py is the first python script.
I have yet to comment it and explain it thoroughly, I hope to get to this soon and release the next python script.

I will release another 2 scripts, one will be on more Fancy plots and the other will be on Complex or Unusual plots.
